        Thor wants to sort his weapons based on increasing value of its power to kill. The best coders in his team have done the task but are unable to sort the data in O(NlogN) time. Try to develop code that can sort the data in the required time complexity.

Constraint:

Power values lie between 0 and 10000

 

Input Description:
Name of weapons with their power denoted beside it.

Output Description:
Weapon named sorted in order of increasing power

Sample Input :
Mjolnir 200
StormBreaker 1000
Asgardian 560
Sample Output :
1 Mjolnir
2 Asgardian
3 StormBreaker
